##  Introduction
This repository documents the journey of Cyberplátano RD, a team representing the Dominican Republic in the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) 2025 – Future Engineers Category, to be held in Panama.

Our goal is to design, build, and program an autonomous robot car capable of completing the competition challenges: the Open Challenge and the Obstacle Challenge. The project integrates mechanical design, electronics, and software, combining skills from 3D printing, circuit design, and programming in C++ and Python.

By sharing our process through this repository, we aim to provide transparency in our work, create a detailed record of our engineering decisions, and contribute to the global robotics community. Every step, from materials and schematics to testing and results, is documented here.
