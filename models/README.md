# Models

This folder contains the 3D models and related files for the Cyberpl√°tanoRD robot project for WRO 2025.

## Files included

- 3D CAD files (e.g., `.stl`, `.step`, `.obj`) for robot components.
- Assembly models showing how the robot parts fit together.
- Any additional reference files used for simulation or design.

## Notes

- Models can be opened with software such as:
  - Fusion 360
  - SolidWorks
  - Blender
  - Webots (for simulation)
- Make sure to check file versions; some parts may have multiple iterations.

## Usage

1. Open the CAD or simulation software of your choice.
2. Import the 3D files from this folder.
3. Follow the assembly references to reconstruct the robot.
4. Use the models in simulations, presentations, or for 3D printing.
